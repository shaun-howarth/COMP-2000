# COMP-2000
Software Engineering 2 - Java Automated Checkout System.

This GitHub Repository contains the source code for the Java Application that is the GUI Automated Checkout System. This project is for the main assignemnt specification for COMP2000. It contains both the Kiosk User Interface and the Stock Database system that will use a flat data source. This application consists of eight (8) pages/GUI forms. This flat data source (file) is a .txt file that contains the products that are in stock alongside with their column name, price, quantity & barcode. Once a user has logged in via the "AdminPage" by entering one of the two admin login credentials they will be brought to the "StockdbPage". Here a user will be able to view current products that are in stock by a click of a button and will also have the ability to add another product to the database file. 

Here are the login credentials for the two admins who have access to view and add items to the stock database:

Username: jasmith	 
Password: canErty6

Username: apbellow
Password: Y$67975f

The "kisokPage" which is the Kiosk user interface will enable a customer (non-admin user)to add products into their shopping basket from the stock db file. There will also be a display box to show the total price a customer will have to pay with their chosen items. A button will then take the customer to a payment screen where they will have the option to pay with cash or card.
